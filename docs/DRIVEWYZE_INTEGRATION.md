longitude: number };\n  vehicleInfo: {\n    weight: number;\n    height: number;\n    length: number;\n    width: number;\n    axles: number;\n    hazmat: boolean;\n  };\n  complianceStatus: {\n    hoursOfService: 'compliant' | 'warning' | 'violation';\n    logbook: 'current' | 'outdated';\n    inspection: 'current' | 'due' | 'overdue';\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Environment Variables\n```bash\nEXPO_PUBLIC_DRIVEWYZE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\nEXPO_PUBLIC_DRIVEWYZE_DEVICE_ID=your_device_id_here\n```\n\n### App Configuration\n```typescript\ninterface DrivewyzeConfig {\n  apiKey: string;\n  deviceId: string;\n  enableNotifications: boolean;\n  autoBypassRequest: boolean;\n  notificationRadius: number; // miles\n  updateInterval: number; // minutes\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Finding Nearby Weigh Stations\n```typescript\nconst { fetchNearbyWeighStations, nearbyStations } = useDrivewyzeStore();\n\n// Fetch stations within 25 miles\nawait fetchNearbyWeighStations(currentLocation, 25);\n\n// Display stations\nnearbyStations.map(station => (\n  <DrivewyzeWeighStationCard \n    key={station.id} \n    station={station} \n    onBypassRequest={() => handleBypass(station)}\n  />\n));\n```\n\n### Requesting Bypass\n```typescript\nconst { requestBypass } = useDrivewyzeStore();\n\nconst bypassRequest: DrivewyzeBypassRequest = {\n  weighStationId: 'ws_001',\n  vehicleId: 'TRUCK001',\n  driverId: 'DRIVER001',\n  currentLocation: { latitude: 39.1612, longitude: -84.4569 },\n  vehicleInfo: {\n    weight: 78000,\n    height: 13.5,\n    length: 65,\n    width: 8.5,\n    axles: 5,\n    hazmat: false\n  },\n  complianceStatus: {\n    hoursOfService: 'compliant',\n    logbook: 'current',\n    inspection: 'current'\n  }\n};\n\nconst response = await requestBypass(bypassRequest);\nif (response?.status === 'approved') {\n  // Handle approved bypass\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Time Savings**: Bypass approved weigh stations to save time\n2. **Fuel Efficiency**: Reduce fuel consumption by avoiding stops\n3. **Compliance**: Maintain better compliance records\n4. **Cost Reduction**: Lower operational costs through efficiency\n5. **Real-time Updates**: Stay informed about weigh station status\n6. **Route Optimization**: Plan routes considering weigh station locations\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- API keys are stored securely in environment variables\n- All API communications use HTTPS\n- Vehicle and driver information is transmitted securely\n- Compliance data is handled according to DOT regulations\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n1. **Route Integration**: Integrate with route optimization\n2. **Predictive Analytics**: Predict bypass approval likelihood\n3. **Fleet Management**: Multi-vehicle bypass coordination\n4. **Advanced Notifications**: Geofenced alerts\n5. **Offline Support**: Cache critical data for offline use\n6. **Voice Commands**: Voice-activated bypass requests\n\n## Support\n\nFor technical support or questions about the Drivewyze integration:\n- Review the official Drivewyze API documentation\n- Check the error logs in the app\n- Contact the development team for assistance\n\n## Compliance Notes\n\n- This integration complies with DOT regulations\n- All bypass decisions are made by Drivewyze systems\n- Drivers must still comply with all applicable regulations\n- Bypass approval does not guarantee exemption from inspection\n
